description: Using the search plugin to sort pages and directories

This plugin, **enabled by default**, adds the `search` helper to your templates.

This helper provides various functions to search and sort pages and directories,
so you can create menus or paginations easily. See
[Search and collecting](/creating-pages/searching/) for more info about this
helper.
