title: Change default configuration
description: Create your own default configuration

In the `_config.js` file, the most easy way to setup lume is by using the
`mod.js` module in this way:

```js
import lume from "lume/mod.ts";

const site = lume();

return site;
```

The function `lume()` creates a `Site` instance with default settings and some
plugins configured, like Markdown, YAML, Nunjucks, etc.

If you want to setup lume from scratch, without this default configuration, you
can import only the `Site` class in order to create an empty instance:

```js
import Site from "lume/site.ts";

const site = new Site();

// Add stuff to your site here

return site;
```

The `Site` instance is empty, so you have to add any plugin or configure it
somehow. For example, if you only need Markdown and Nunjucks, you could do
something like this:

```js
import Site from "lume/site.ts";
import markdown from "lume/plugins/markdown.ts";
import nunjucks from "lume/plugins/nunjucks.ts";

const site = new Site();

return site
  .use(markdown())
  .use(nunjucks());
```
