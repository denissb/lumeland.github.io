If you use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), it's
recommended to install the following extensions to improve the development
experience:

- [Deno](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno):
  the official Deno extension that performs type checking, module resolutions,
  linting, formatting, etc.
- [Lume](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=oscarotero.vscode-lume):
  This extension configure Deno to use the Lume import map in order to remove
  problems by using "bare import specifiers" in the config file.
